Working on Intragram data in MySQL Workbench

As a final project for 'Go from SQL Beginner to Expert' course led by Colt Steele, I worked on some instagramish data and I would like to share the quieries that I wrote myself.

Here is what I did:
1. INSERT a ton of data
2. Prepaired querries to answer the following questions:
- We want to reward our users who have been around the longest. Find the 5 oldest users.
- What day of the week do most users register on? We need to figure out when to schedule an ad campgain.
- We want to target our inactive users with an email campaign. Find the users who have never posted a photo.
- We're running a new contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo. WHO WON??!!
- Our Investors want to know... How many times does the average user post?
- A brand wants to know which hashtags to use in a post. What are the top 5 most commonly used hashtags?
- We have a small problem with bots on our site... Find users who have liked every single photo on the site.
- We also have a problem with celebrities. Find users who have never commented on a photo.
